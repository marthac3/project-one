## Purpose

This is a simplified game of Minesweeper I created in order to improve my skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Functionality

The game can be played at three different grid sizes (difficulty levels). The game functions like normal minesweeper, clicking on squares to reveal how many mines are nearby and using these to try to avoid mines until all non-mine squares have been cleared. If a mine is clicked on, the game is over. However, unlike normal minesweeper, this version does not include flags to mark where known mines are, and the grid must always be square.

When a game is won, you win points based on the difficulty of the game.

The difficulty you are playing at is displayed next to the grid, as is your score.

The game includes an option to return to the main menu, which resets the game.
